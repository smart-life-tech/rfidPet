#Explanation:

The code initializes the RFID reader and the stepper motor.
When an RFID tag is detected, the stepper motor moves to the open position.
The gate stays open for a specified delay time (DELAY_TIME).
After the delay, the stepper motor moves back to the closed position.
Adjustments:

You may need to adjust the stepper.moveTo() values based on your specific gate mechanism.
Ensure the power supply can handle the current required by the stepper motor.
Fine-tune the stepper.setMaxSpeed() and stepper.setAcceleration() values for smooth operation.
